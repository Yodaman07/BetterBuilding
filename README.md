#  BetterBuilding
**Description:** A Minecraft mod that adds better building tools to the game

**Made By:** LegoBrosBuild, with assistance from PenguinEncounter

## Features
1. Click on a plank to change its type
2. Lock the plank type
3. Shift-clicking connected planks will change all of them
4. Typing `/wand bind` while holding an item will bind the wand to that item. There is a golden tooltip beneath the item to let you know what item is currently bound
5. `config.txt` has been added. This now saves the state of: `useDiagonals, isLocked, woodNum, and boundWand`
