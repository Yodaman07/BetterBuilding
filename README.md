# BetterBuilding

**Description:** A Minecraft mod that adds better building tools to the game

**Made By:** LegoBrosBuild, with assistance from PenguinEncounter

## Features

1. Click on a plank to change its type.
2. Lock the plank type.
3. Shift-clicking connected planks will change all of them. There is a menu option `Use Diagonals` for limiting the reach of the connected plank.
4. Typing `/wand bind` while holding an item will bind the wand to that item. There is a golden tooltip beneath the item to let you know what item is currently bound.
5. Typing `/wand give` will give you the currently bound wand. You will be given `air` if the value is set to `null` (this happens upon crashing your game).
6. `config.txt` has been added. This now saves the state of: `useDiagonals, isLocked, woodNum, boundWand, and guiPosition`.
7. There is a gui that pops up on your hud displaying the currently selected, and upcoming blocks. Its position can be changed in the menu under `Hud Position`.
